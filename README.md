## Introduction

I have always wanted a website that was versatile and has the functionality to do certain things without having the need to constantly edit code and manually perform entries and needing to push onto GitHub.

I finally have decided to take the leap and create my own fullstack online portfolio and hosting it on a proper server with a domain name and all. This is so I can finally say that I have a proper website that I can be proud of. Testimonials, modular projects page, a backend database scheme to store data and build my website upon, and even a blog page! I can tell I am going to love this project :)

## Motivation/Inspiration

I browsed through YouTube and came across various videos of people showcasing their online websites dedicated to deploy a storytelling medium about themselves. All of them were unique and cool in their own respective ways. Some had blog posts that they update every week. Some had dedicated contact forms for various entities. Some had mini-games on their website!

This was enough to make me want to have my own website where I have full control and creativity over.

## Idea/Framework

_v1_ | The idea is to first have a simple all-in-one page where it is divided intto segments (vertically) and the contents of each segment can be viewed within the segment itself (horizontally). The different segments are as follows: greeting, about, projects, experience, creditations, testimonials, blog posts, contact form.
